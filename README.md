# Hi There! 🤘

I'm Lukas – **SE** from 🇵🇱 Poland, now living in sunny 🇵🇹 Portugal (Faro).

With over **15 years** of 💻 **commercial experience**, I've had the pleasure of working with **corporates**, agile **software houses**, as well as super **dynamic startups**. Recently, I've been involved as a **Developer**, further as a **Successful Team Leader** on an amazing **open source ecommerce** front-end platform, [**Vue Storefront**](https://alokai.com/). 

When I'm not coding, I'm **organizing meetups**, giving **talks at conferences**, contributing to **open source**, and **mentoring** others. Currently, I'm busy **building my own product**(s) using a modern TypeScript / Nuxt / AI stack. I also offer technical consultancy on the side.

Outside of tech, I'm: 
* an avid 🚴 cyclist,
* a data focused, AI trained 🏃 runner,
* a modern 🎸 hardcore music fan,
* a productivity 📚 books enthusiast,
* an alternative ☕ coffee.

I **share my journey** and **insights** about:
* programming on [medium](https://medium.com/@lukasborawski),
* vue/nuxt on [vue.house](https://vue.house/),
* running on [thehalfhero.com](https://thehalfhero.com/),
* music on [justbeforethedrop.com](https://justbeforethedrop.com/).
