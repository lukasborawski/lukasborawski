# Hi There! 🤘

I'm Lukas – **SE** / **UID** / **TL** from 🇵🇱 Poland, now living in sunny 🇵🇹 Portugal (Faro).

With over **15 years** of my 💻 **commercial experience**, I've had the pleasure of working with **corporates**, **software houses**, as well as **dynamically scaled startups**. I would say that my best environment to exist and thrive is an early / greenfield stage - less structured with multiple roles assigned. 

Recently, I've been involved as a **Developer**, further as a **Successful Team Leader** (building couple of them) on a super **fast-growing**, **open source**, **ecommerce** platform, [**Vue Storefront**](https://alokai.com/). Currently, I'm busy building my **own product**(s) using a modern TypeScript / Node / Vue / AI stack. I also offer interim technical support and consultancy on the side.

When I'm not coding, I'm **organizing meetups**, giving **talks** at **conferences**, and contributing to **open source**. 

Outside of tech, I'm: 
* an avid 🚴 cyclist,
* a data focused, AI trained 🏃 runner,
* a modern 🎸 hardcore music fan,
* a productivity 📚 books enthusiast,
* an alternative ☕ coffee.

I **share my journey** and **insights** about:
* programming on [medium](https://medium.com/@lukasborawski),
* vue/nuxt on [vue.house](https://vue.house/),
* running on [thehalfhero.com](https://thehalfhero.com/),
* music on [justbeforethedrop.com](https://justbeforethedrop.com/).

Feel free to explore my repositories – you might discover the perfect library for your awesome project!
